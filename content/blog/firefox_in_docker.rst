Running Firefox in Docker
=========================

Turns out you can run Firefox in Docker. It's actually pretty easy:

Code
----

**From** `my github gist`_.

.. raw:: html

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ElijahCaine/29e7e829341d58abe370.js"></script>

Installation instructions (on Linux):

.. code:: text

    # install docker and start the docker daemon
    $ git clone https://gist.github.com/29e7e829341d58abe370.git docker-firefox
    $ ln docker-firefox/ff-docker /some/path/for/binaries
    $ ff-docker -b  # -b pulls & builds container, etc used for first time startup.

Notes
-----

I attempted to use `Alpine Linux`_ as a proof-of-usability, since it's the hip
new kid on the containerization block [1]_, but as it turns out Alpine's
Firefox package is pretty fucked [2]_.

I use `dmenu`_, this means I can run ``ff-docker`` from my desktop without
opening a terminal, effectively making it a super-private-yet-convenient
drop-in for Firefox.  Pretty neat right?

Conclusion
----------

This was pretty simple but effective in terms of giving me the option to have
more privacy. I can see it being extended to add even more security; e.g.,
routing all of the traffic in the container through a VPN would be easy enough.
Food for thought [citation needed].

.. [1] 5mb containers sounds pretty nice to me.
