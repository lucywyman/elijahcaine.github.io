A Rising Tide Lifts All Apps
============================

..  Did you know you can run a Flask app in a screen session and use proxypass
    to host it on a subdomain? It's so easy and way faster than using WSGI!  --
    SLAP -- NO! Never do that. I understand the appeal, I've been there. You
    just want to get your dumb hack-of-an-app out the door.

..  So ansible is a thing. It made me a better dev by making me follow the
    right way to do things instead of the hack, snowflakey, way to do things.
