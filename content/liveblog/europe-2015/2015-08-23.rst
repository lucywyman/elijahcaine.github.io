All Packed
----------

So I'm all packed up and ready to go.

**Left:** Chargers, electronics, entertainment, toiletries, water bottle,
wallet, etc.

**Center:** The bag, the *Write the Docs* shirt I'll be wearing.

**Right:** Clothing. Gameboy SP at the top.

Not the *perfect* bag of things to bring to Europe, but certainly solid and
most of it practical. I'm packing an extra bag for all of the trinkets I'll
bring back.

Let me know if you want anything (if you know how to contact me we're close
enough for you to ask.)
