*I'm not sure which street I took this panorama on, but I think it looks
awesome. It captures the Amsterdam canal street pretty well.*

Today I went to the Rijks Museum and had a bit of a culture overload.

Everybody got selfies with Van Gough, so I got a selfie The Milkmaid.  I
realize in retrospect that it doesn't work as well. 

In other news, this is my face when I realized the bathroom stalls go from
floor to ceiling.

*Yes, this photo was taken in the bathroom stall.*

And this is a classy restaurant I found with classy lamps.

*They were closed, otherwise I would have gone in.*

Some Travel Tips 
---------------- 

Although I have not completed my trip, I have some tips to share 
with you about travel. 

* Always bring a 'Go Bag' when you go out for the day. Fill it with snacks and
  necessities and leave plenty of room for memorabilia you get while out and
  about. 
* Try something new before defaulting to your comfort zone. This is true for
  food as well as experiences. 
* Always being plenty of snacks and water. You will regret it if you don't. 
* Be patient. You invested a lot to get here, make it count. 
* At a museum, take a picture of the plackard after taking a picture of the
  piece so you don't forget what it's called. 
* Don't be afraid to sit in a caf√© and just read for a bit. Sometimes that's as
  culturally diversifying as a day in a museum or city tour.
