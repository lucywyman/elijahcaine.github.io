===================

Today I visited the Van Gough museum. I tried to get in using my mom's
Amsterdam Museum Pass, but it didn't fly there like it did at the Rijks. 

It was pretty fun, but the entire experience felt very artificial and plastic.
The paintings were great to see in person, but everything around the pieces
felt a little tacky. My opinion will likely change about it, but I did not
enjoy the Van Gough museum nearly as much as I enjoyed the Rijks Museum,
despite my love for Van Gough and his works. 

I spent the rest of the day walking around and cashed in early. Jetlag + lots
of walking = ready for bed by 3pm.
