=================== 

I Strongly Dislike Travel 
------------------------- 

I would say I hate travel, but that level of hyperbole is literally the worst
thing on the planet... 

My strong dislike for travel comes mostly from my personal inability to trust
the systems that will get me to where I am going. If I have a flight in one
week and I have to take a bus or train to the airport, I will spend the entire
week running through my head "When is my flight? Umm days, yeesh hours, and ack
minutes. How am I getting there? The oh God bus leaving at some time, somewhere
bound.  Once you get there you will go through security which will take between
5 minutes and 2 hours. Budget your time appropriately.  Any of these systems
can fail and based on experience they have" over and over and over. The stress
is compounded when people don't always speak your language and you forgot to
eat a proper meal the morning of. 

*That* is why I am 3 hours early to my flight from Amsterdam to Prague. I
regret nothing.

It is going to take me forever to remember *25 here monies is about 1 home
monies*. Everything is gonna feel really expensive I bet... 

I Made it to Prague
-------------------

I made it to Prague just fine. They have a cool train system.

Way cooler than the underground train systems I'm used to...
