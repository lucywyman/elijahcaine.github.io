Prague Day 1
------------

I went on a wonderful `city tour`_ of Prague provided by Write The Docs. We
crossed some bridges, saw some castles, and experienced many wonderful parts of
the city.

*Here's me in front of a church eating some gelato.*

After the tour I was very hungry and tagged along with some folks from my tour
group on a journey to get food. We went to a restaurant that brought us beer on
a model train.

Here are some picture I took of the buildings in the city. I like the
architecture a lot.

*They are so cool. I haven't found the words to describe why, but the asthetics
please me.*

After the tour and food there was a *Write the Docs Conference Reception* (aka
meet & greet) where I got to hang out with many of the attendees of the
conference. There was food and fabulous people.

I did not have a hard time falling asleep that night.
