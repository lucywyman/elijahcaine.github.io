    <p><strong>First thing's First: I went on a trip and wrote a travelblog.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>For a link to that travelblog itself check out</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://elijahcaine.me/eurotrip-2015">eli&shy;jah&shy;caine.me/eurotrip-2015</a></p>
<p><strong>This post is _about_ that travelblog.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I went on a whirlwind two week trip to Europe; first to Amsterdam ('because
Amsterdam' seems like a reasonable jus&shy;ti&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion for doing this according to
most people) and second to Prague to speak at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/schedule/">European Write the Docs
conference</a>.</p>
<p>I've traveled before and I wanted to avoid the inevitable that tends to happen:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>I go on a trip.</li>
<li>Have a wonderful time and make lots of memories.</li>
<li>Get back from trip.</li>
<li>Get asked &quot;Tell me about your trip!&quot;</li>
<li>Forget everything that happened on the trip and sum it up with 'It was
great.'</li>
</ol>
<p>To combat this seemingly inevitable outcome I decided to write a blog about
<strong>this</strong> trip as the trip was happening. Similar to how some might make daily
Facebook posts or Tweets, I could use this as a way to not only spend time each
day processing what happened but I could also refer friends and family to the
blog's url so they could follow along vic&shy;ar&shy;i&shy;ous&shy;ly if they chose. I wanted to
make a website where I updated the world on my where&shy;abouts and shenani&shy;gans.</p>
<p>And so I did.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-technical-parts">
<h2>The Technical Parts</h2>
<p>I'm an engineer. Like many engineers I like to tinker and build things.</p>
<p>A while ago I built a tool called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/elijahcaine/pageup#pageup-init-pageup-build">PageUp</a>; it takes a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">re&shy;Struc&shy;tured&shy;Text</a>
formatted <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup file</a>, an <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system">html template</a>, as well as some other files that
make the web go 'round and look half-way decent.</p>
<p>Using that tool (PageUp) I created a blog that I could update from my phone
using <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/ElijahCaine/352cb120743af2dde7c8">a Github Gist</a> and a slick <a class="reference external" href="http://www.git-scm.com/">Git Source Control</a> program for my phone.
I could write a re&shy;Struc&shy;tured&shy;Text formatted blog post, sync it to the web, have
my personal server pull the updated version of the <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/ElijahCaine/352cb120743af2dde7c8">git repository</a>, and
au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly rebuild the website.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-writing-parts">
<h2>The Writing Parts</h2>
<p>Updates were sur&shy;pris&shy;ing&shy;ly painless-- and I'm not just saying that to sell
PageUp, I'm honestly just impressed that I made something which actually made
my life easier. Feels good.</p>
<p>I wasn't as consistent with writing posts as I had envisioned. I wrote posts
the day after the events occurred, which wasn't too bad, until I went to Write
the Docs got completely torn away from my rigorous 'Drink Coffee, Write
Blogpost, Adventure' regimen; I kept getting distracted by meeting new people
and so&shy;cial&shy;iz&shy;ing. Ugh, the worst.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="thoughts-and-conclusions">
<h2>Thoughts and Con&shy;clu&shy;sions</h2>
<p>All in all I suspect I'll continue doing liveblogs when I go to events, it's a
great way to share the experience with others and augment one's memory with a
written record of the time you spent.</p>
<p>Plus it's just fun an nerdy to write scripts and programs to make this whole
experience as user friendly as possible. If I poured even more time into this
it could even be a startup...</p>
